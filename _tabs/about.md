Hi! I am Muhammed Anas, a full-time Research Engineer at the NUS Satellite Technology and Research (STAR) Centre. I am part of the software team and I maintain the ground software used to communicate with satellites and develop flight software to be deployed on satellites.

I am a tech enthusiast who enjoys coding, especially developing embedded systems software. I like to solve problems through code and share that joy with others. This homepage is therefore a natural result of that. I use this to discuss my current hobby projects and experiments. This website is statically generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Do you like what you see? Perhaps you have ideas for a new project or suggestions to improve my current ones. Whatever the case, I welcome you to get in touch with me via my socials and we can discuss ðŸ˜Š
